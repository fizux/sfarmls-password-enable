# sfarmls-password-enable
Tampermonkey script to allow user to login using a password manager rather than retyping a complex password by hand 20 times a day.

Designed to work on the SFAR MLS login page at https://iam.sfarmls.com/idp/login

You will need this: https://www.tampermonkey.net/

Please do not be an idiot with this. If you manage to find a way to compromise your MLS password, that is on you.
